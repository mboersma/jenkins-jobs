# Deis Workflow Jenkins Jobs

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer to any [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers.

For more information about the Deis Workflow, please visit the main project page at https://github.com/deis/workflow.

# About

This repository serves as a central location for [Deis Workflow Jenkins jobs](https://ci.deis.io) represented in [Jenkins Job DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin).

## Resources

The definitive wiki resource describing all available Jenkins Job DSL API items can be found in the [Jenkins Job DSL Plugin API](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/).

Until we add support for [testing DSL changes](https://github.com/deis/jenkins-jobs/issues/39) while developing, the [Jenkins Job DSL Playground](http://job-dsl.herokuapp.com/) can be used for verifying that the DSL parses correctly.  (If it does, an `xml` file will be generated.  For comparison, you can view an existing job's `xml` equivalent by navigating to `https://ci.deis.io/job/<job-name>/config.xml`)
